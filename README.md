## Features

### Refined Syntax Highlighting

Enjoy more precise and visually appealing syntax highlighting with our meticulously refined tmLanguage grammar. We've covered most SystemVerilog features to ensure your code stands out.

### Robust Highlighting Mechanisms

Our syntax highlighting adapts and remains robust, maintaining clarity even with incomplete or unconventional code structures:

- **Immediate Recognition**: Syntax elements are highlighted as soon as they're detected. Partially written code identified by leading keywords becomes readable instantly.

- **Resilient Parsing**: Our parser handles scenarios like improperly terminated code structures. For example, if a function within a module isn't closed correctly, the rest of your code retains its syntax highlighting integrity.

### Minimized TextMate JSON File

We've optimized our extension by implementing JSON file minification, reducing its size to about 90% of the original for smooth and efficient operation.

## How to Contribute

Your contributions are highly valued! Whether you create pull requests or simply report issues regarding incorrect highlighting, your input helps us improve.
